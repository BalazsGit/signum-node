## Signum Phoenix Wallet lives in another repository!

In this folder it will be copied the files of the folder `src/` from the repository (phoenix-wallet)[https://github.com/signum-network/phoenix].

The process is automated during a release creation. For more info check the `release.yml` workflow.

If you want to install it manually, or update to a newer Phoenix version run: `./update-phoenix.sh`
